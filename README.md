# Lit Review
This project is a platform for readers and authors to share their insights and writing with a community of people with similar interests in books and reading! The project is built using the ReactJS framework, with Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the front-end. It also makes use of Bootstrap for styling. The backend is done using Node.js, and the relevant code is in my [lit-review-server-app](https://github.com/veeeena/lit-review-server-app) repository. 

The application supports CRUD operations for users, books, and reviews. There are two types of end users, readers and authors, with different CRUD abilities. It also makes use of the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to get information about and allow users to make reviews for books not created by users. 

The website's frontend is hosted on [Netlify](https://main--endearing-brioche-ccf704.netlify.app/).
